title: "About the 'TideCatcher'"
---

Hello, I'm gnailcn, a 'Wandering TideCatcher' strolling on the shores of the digital age.

I believe the ocean of knowledge is vast and boundless. Every technological iteration, every collision of ideas, is like a tide. When the tide recedes, it always leaves behind countless treasures waiting to be discovered.

I created this little site to document my process of "tide-catching."

Here, what I salvage might be a piece of elegant code or a brilliant algorithm—these are the shining 'shells' in the waves of information. I also look up to the grand ideas that guide our direction and the life philosophies that shift our perspectives—these are the 'stars' that offer eternal guidance in the night sky.

This blog is the basket where I keep these shells and stars. It holds what I've learned, what I've thought, and what I've felt, witnessing how an ordinary person builds their own cognitive system amidst the flood of information.

May I share the joy of this tide-catching with you, a fellow explorer.
